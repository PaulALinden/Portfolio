# Portfolio
## Portfolio page made with React and Tailwind.

Welcome to my evolving portfolio page, where I offer a glimpse into the projects I've undertaken throughout my academic journey. As a student, I've been engaged in various endeavors, some of which are showcased here in their early stages, reflecting my growth and development over time.

Stay tuned as I continue to enrich this portfolio with more projects that highlight my skills and interests. One upcoming addition is my thesis project, where I'm delving into the creation of an innovative app for everyday commerce. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Foodora, this app aims to streamline daily transactions and enhance user experiences.

In this project, I'm not only focusing on crafting a seamless user interface but also diving deep into the backend development. Leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot, Android, Firebase Realtime Database, and MySQL, I'm building a robust foundation to support the app's functionalities and ensure optimal performance.

I invite you to explore my portfolio, witness my journey, and see how my passion for technology and problem-solving translates into tangible projects that make a difference.
